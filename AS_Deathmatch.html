		<h2>A tale of Artificial Sparks:</h2>
			<p><i>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At some point of time in the multiverse, a plan had been hatched to create half a dozen planeswalkers to prevent the extinction of an entire species. It might work.</i></p>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This DND campaign will follow my players as they travel the multiverse, solving the mystery of six demon lords and their rivals planning their destruction, with various plots intercepting and overlapping as they go.</p>
		<h3>The Plan?</h3>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am going to be hosting a one on one session which each of my three best friends, introducing their characters, the
			worlds around them, and putting them through fights before having a traumatic event occur at the end of each story, each involving a demon
			lord, described in the NPC's page, who all have a plot together, igniting each of my player's sparks and turning them into planewalkers 
			where they will crash into each other on the desert plane of Amonkhet.</p>

			<p><i>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This'll be where I get to summarize the plot of any session.</i></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Round 1: A goblin's fall.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kelp woke up and met Auntie Frag who yelled at him to get out into the world, so he made his way towards town, attempting to trip the goblin artificer Arki. This failed, but he did catch the eye of the water bottle sized idol the artificer was carrying into his abode. While in the town center, Kelp met the rabblerouser Pelograh, who is adamant that a demon is coming back into town. While discussing this fact, the goblins heard a shatter and crash from the same direction of Kelp's home and the goblin rushed to save his auntie. On his way however, he found the real source of the crash and laid eyes on Ar-for-Gut, named by Wecta - the former being a large, orange stone golem, that went and began rampaging, so Kelp began to fight it alongside the goblin rogue Loda, the goblin fighter Grizak, the fissure wizard, Kalgut, and the Kor berserker Wotur.</p>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With Grizak laying the final blow on the golem with his magical fiery blade, and taking quite a tumble from the top of the statue which changed back into the totem, he was in critical condition. Wotur ran to him and began rushing him to the clinic as Kelp made his way to the idol, with Loda making his way to the kid, Kalgut, and introducing himself. After picking up, inspecting, and pocketing the totem, Kelp made his way into the home of Arki and found that it was half destroyed with the inhabitant killed. Loda joined him and asked him to join a team he was starting to venture into the rock and uncover the secrets of the totem. Kelp agreed and went to convince a wounded Grizak to join while Loda worked the kid. Across town, Kelp entered the overgrown hedron of the clinic and met the elf Karola, running the clinic and convinced the red headed goblin to join the team, as they would meet up tomorrow morning when he's healed. He also cleverly saw that the elf and Grizak definitely had a relationship past nurse and patient. After making it back to town square, Kelp noticed the shadows not doing what they're supposed to and dragged Pelograh into a dark alley. Noticing they were being stalked by Wotur, Kelp began running back home and slammed his door as Auntie Frag explained that Wotur had been by, talking about Ar-for-Gut and worrying about shadows, Kelp realizing that Wotur meant no harm, and began knocking at the door. </p>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After discussing the shadows for a moment, one jumped at the pair and knocked Wotur off of the Increk, Kelp incinerating the shade and helping Wotur back up before offering him to join their team to head into the rock to discover the secrets of the idol and the Shade infestation. Kelp then noticed his statue was missing but went to bed anyway, waking up fresh and drinking a sip of salt water before shooting a sky-manta out of the sky with a firebolt, causing the elf rider to fall towards the town. After rushing out the door in panic, he saw Karola grappling from the rock, recovering just fine but obviously confused as to why her sky manta ignited. With the five meeting up, they made their way to the clinic wher Grizak heard about the manta incident with Kelp keeping his head down before the group made their way into the rock by climbing the clinic's hedron. Travelling the tunnels for a while by following Loda, the group was informed of the different kinds of creatures that live down here including worms and many insects, alon with a few mysteries probably. After dealing with a quicksand trap which had already worked up Wotur, it proved Kelp is very headstrong, not listening the Kor who would've helped the situation. They made it to the temple and had all of their numbers as the room erupted into shades. During the ensuing chaos, Grizak gravely wounded Loda, Kalgut activated Ar-for-Gut and hurt Wotur who raged and stabbed the kid. Kelp ended up burning hands and killed two shades along with Wotur the Kor, saving the kid but watching as a shade executed Loda, Kalgut accidentally igniting his body. </p>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With the passive shades still flying at the top of the room, Kelp looted Loda and found 10 platinum coins, as the room began to rumble and collapse. The kid was dragged and pulled away from Grizak and Kelp, the latter making a dash for Kalgut while Grizak offered reassurance before falling from the rock. Kelp got Kalgut down and laid eyes on the demon in the doorway. Using jump, he made it to the other side of the room with a missing floor and he and Kalgut began pulling at a wall made of loose rocks, attempting to excape. Kelp then turned and saw that the demon's shadow was holding the kid over the cliff in the cave and told Kelp to jump, or Kalgut will be dropped. To counter this, Kelp leaped to Kalgut, grabbed him, and Kelp and his son began falling towards the sea, a mile below. </p>

		<h3>DM Bio</h3>
			<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have been engrossed in the magic storyline for almost a decade now, with DnD being a more recent interest. I have never dm'd but I figured my obscene amount of information about the mtg multiverse would help with it and I have truly enjoyed writing about it and planning story points even if I still haven't gotten to play the story at all.</p>
