			<h3>Plane - Amonkhet</h3>
			<p><i>On the desert plane of Amonkhet, sentient characters are split heavily between those who live in a settlement and those who don't.</i></p>

					<p><i>Desert of the glorified, Amonkhet</i></p>
						<blockquote>
							<h4>Chisis, Last Vizier of Kefnet</h4>
								<blockquote>
									<p> &nbsp &nbsp An ex-vizier of Kefnet, this Naga shaman is the utmost authority of things not of this
									world on Amonkhet, finding and archiving any information she can on planeswalking, planeswalkers, and
									the blind eternities. She wields a poison dagger (1d4 poison damage) and has many servant mummies in her
									workshop, which is in a tiny pyramid just outside of the new Hekma.</p>
									<p><i><b>Quotes</b> - "Bolas was a sexist, horrible creature, as I've heard our plane
									is the only one without female angels, and I can only wish to see the grace of
									one of them."</i></p>
									<p><i> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - "I only sense a single spark between the three of you... how
									the hell did any of you manage to lose an abstract concept?"</i></p>
									<p><i> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - "Hey, did... What happened to Heptor? Is he, you know, part of
									the accursed now?"</i></p>
								</blockquote>
							<h4>Hazoret, God-Survivor</h4>
								<blockquote>
									<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The only remaining non-feral god on Amonkhet, this Jackel headed god still enjoys the worship of her subjects, but doesn't use that position lightly, as she protects her flock Zealously. Met when she throws a pyramid at a horde of accursed summoned by Heptor to flush out the players.</p>
									<p><i><b>Quotes</b> - "Children not of this world, come with me, you won't last
									another hour out here."</i></p>
									<p><i> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - "We expelled Heptor from the barrier
									only a few weeks ago, as he had become chaotic with his ideas to take down the two
									remaining feral gods. He suggested we do exactly what Bolas did, which is the worst
									suggestion since Bontu's ask of betrayal."</i></p>
								</blockquote>
							<h4>Heptor, Wanderer with the Accursed</h4>
								<blockquote>
									<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first character our PC's end up meeting on Amonkhet who manages to save them from a
									sandworm attack, before complimenting the group and asking if they would join his lonesome quest to 
									take out the remaining broken gods of Amonkhet. </p>
									<p><i><b>Quotes</b> - "You all look like you need a drink, your faces are not 
									unlike the zombies they kept within the Hekma."</i></p>
									<p><i> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp - "By Razaketh, you each fought very well, would you like
									to join my cause to rid t of the land of the last two broken gods that continue to scour the dunes?
									I, along with the people beyond the Hekma would be eternally greatful."</i></p>
