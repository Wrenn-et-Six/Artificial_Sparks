							<tr>
								<td> &nbsp &nbsp This Rakdos demon is a puppeteer in the circus of the demonlord
								himself, being known for his extreme abilities to attract and summon imps, humanoid, 
								devil like entities, that serve as his heralds and fighters. When not performing in
								the undercity, he is still out of view of the skies, as his tormentor is constantly
								patrolling, searching for another notch on her belt. His voice booms throughout
								stadiums, frightening many while his firewielding provides more fuel for fear.</td>
								<td> &nbsp &nbsp Always on the move, the demon from the Immursturm keeps his fair share
								of omenpaths and doomskar starters in his pockets, to be able to travel and escape whatever he
								needs to, being the most mobile and hard to catch. While on the run, he keeps to the hordes
								of demons in vain attempts to blend in, since each of the six were artifical.</td>
								<td> &nbsp &nbsp Often finding a way to be silhoetted by the grand and important moon
								of Innistrad, this succubi like demon is known for her brutality, often terrifying other,
								lesser demons into submission, a fact she basks in. She is the only one of the six demons 
								who has slain her advesary, occuring only a few years ago, right after of which, the other 
								demons began to be hunted more frequently.</td>
								<td> &nbsp &nbsp A lanky, bone covered naga-like demon of Ifnir, he is often seen as the lesser demon
								of the six, due to his exceedingly low intellect. This can be useful, as he's easily mistaken
								for something lesser, allowing for a guard being let down to be someone's downfall. Often hangs
								out with other demons on Amonkhet since he could easily get picked off by his advesary in the
								broken sands. Necromantic and Sand magic are his specialties, often summoning hordes of the 
								accursed that are shrounded in dust.</td>
								<td> &nbsp &nbsp Also known as the demon of concealed courtyards, this bulky
								rust covered demon was artifically constructed to look similar to a gearhulk on 
								Kaladesh,but makes many modifications to himself, constantly hiding from the villian
								hunting him. His raspy voice can be carried through dying Aetherborn, their
								lives extended a few extra moments to serve as his messengers. He means no ill
								will for this, only that both sides can benefit from it, the Aetherborn gets to
								live a few extra hours, and he doesn't get seen by the city all too often.</td>
								<td> &nbsp &nbsp The shade demon of Zendikar, living in the ruins of an ondu skycave, he serves as
								the main communicator of the six, managing to sync the minds of each through his runic home, allowing them
								to actually plot. Being a shade, he has two forms, his shadow which is exactly that, but can interact with
								the world, and his actual body, which is much less terrifying, simply the size of a normal Zendikari shade,
								as if you'd ever see that part of him.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "Who stands before me and my children? Oh, it's you. Wait, where are the rest of all
								of you, along with your sparks? What the hell went wrong in blasted Zendikari's plan!"</i></td>
								<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "How in the - how did you find me? Oh Zilra, I'm sorry about your abode, but the cat
								is okay - I really like her. She helped me slay a cosmos monster the other day by biting it's toe - your
								cat is a real fighter."</i></td>
								<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "You children don't understand, I've had enough of that monster. I know 
								you humanoids have another word for what he put me through. Attempting to excerising a
								demon from itself is a torturous process, so I had enough."</i></td>
								<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "I don't give a sssshit what you think of me, I may have been the creation
								of a sick planeswalker with a kink for watching celesssstial and infernal beings duking it out but
								that doesn't make me any lessss of a demon."</i></td>
								<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "Did Yarunti go peacefuly? They have been with me since a week after									they came to be. Anyway, where are the rest of you? There should be five of you... since I failed. Should've
								chosen a being with a longer life than one of my Aetherborn, but I'll see if I can bring her back."</i></td>
								<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "By now, the planeswalker is out of the plane, and yes, we were all created
								by an emmencly powerful mage, along with our advesaries as either a sick joke or as a proper balence
								to the multiverse's most powerful races. What our foes fail to realize is that balance is key, and we
								just have to exist with one another, as much as either side hates it - The Angels are simply too high
								on their rightous fury that we are impure."</i></td>

								<tr>
									<td> &nbsp &nbsp The most reclusive of the Angels, she sided herself with the Azorious senate on Ravnica, in charge of bringing about and upholding ancient laws. On her own, she is uninterested in the logic of the six, but will listen to her fellow angels and is ready to assault the Rakdos stronghold that Borthod lurks in, as they've both only been growing more powerful with years, never actually fighting.</td>
									<td> &nbsp &nbsp A Valkyrie from Starnheim on Kaldheim, Karaja often creates new omen paths in her and Fathagoth's game of cat and mouse, where the reaper tracks the demon through the realms to take down and kill, leaving the demon to make allies everywhere but rarely stand still.</td>
									<td> &nbsp &nbsp Killed a few weeks ago by Anthramos, one of the angels that sticks out due to the fact he is Male, meaning that he is disconnected from the normal flights of Innistrad, and instead has spent most of his time researching their condition and building a large mansion for himself and the 6's story. Before he was killed however, he went on a rightous spree and began hunting, capturing, and torturing Anthramos over and over again - For sport or for a reason we don't know, but Anthramos had to do something.</td>
									<td> &nbsp &nbsp One of the males, he looks much like the other angels of the plane of Amonkhet, lanky and sometimes mummified, often pursuing the dumbest of the demons, or at least everyone percieves him as stupid. Solinius is also one of the two Angels that we actually know the location of, as Phet has successfully made him beleive that Phet's nest is somewhere in or around the enchanted dragon horns, leading to it being his most common location around this time.</td>
									<td> &nbsp &nbsp The robotic Kaladesh angel is often scouring the city of Ghirapir for the demon they hunt, attempting to kill and dismantle Dustrius since in their eyes, they are the living embodiment of rust, which is wrong and imperfect, therefore must be ended as quickly as possible, leaving Dustrius to lurk in the shadows always.</td>
									<td> &nbsp &nbsp With her main base in Seagate these days, the Zendikari angel used to have the greatest battles with the shade demon Abyzof, but has since retired after being unable to find him for so long. She keeps up with the times and goes on adventures with parties but never forgets her endgame, as she is one of those down with destroying each of the demons.</td>

									<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "Let us wait it out, time will let evil fall."</i></td>
									<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "That particular raider is MINE, child, you can deal with the rest."</i></td>
									<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "You WILL be saved, in time, now hold still."</i></td>
									<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "I'm not crazy - I know he's here! I CAN SMELL YOU HERETIC!"</i></td>
									<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "Impurity is weakness, we were equals, but now you are lesser."</i></td>
									<td><i><b>Quotes</b> - "My party will one day slay Abyzof for the last time, until then, we'll stay rich."</i></td>
