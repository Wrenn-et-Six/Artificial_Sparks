		<h2>Locations on Amonkhet</h2>
		<td><img src="images/Amonkhet.jpg" width="100%"/></td>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
			<h4>Convergence point</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A fairly unassuming dune in the middle of the sandwurm sands of Amonkhet, it just happens to be where our players meet and end up running into the survivor Heptor.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>Heptor's Pit</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upkept by Heptor's two servant mummies, and protected by his Crocodile and Human Eternals, this stone platform in a large valley serves as his sacrificial point, where unknowing to anyone who sees, dozens of accursed lurk just below the surface of the sands. He takes the players here if they choose to side with him on his Quest. </p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>Beyond the Hekma</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Survivor's encampment built in the safety of a new barrier, retaining servant mummies and keeping out the accursed as much as they can - it is theorized that 99.99% of the sentient beings on amonkhet live in here, despite being only a few dozen thousand strong.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>A God's lounge</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The abode of Hazoret, with citizens worshiping at her feet, and a large pyramid crushed to serve as her bed, it is the meeting place for plans about the encampment, where survivors step up on a tall stage in the center to discuss their ideas. Heptor once stood there.</p>

		<h2>Locations on Zendikar</h2>
		<td><img src="images/Zendikar.jpg" width="100%"/></td>
		<blockquote>
			<h4>Temple to shadows</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just past the shade filled room that collapsed at the end of Kelp's first session is a rock wall that when torn down properly (already started by Kalgut and Kelp) it reveals a six pedastuled room, each serving as a powerful link to another world, allowing six abyssal entities to comminucate with one another. </p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>The Increk</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A village jutting off the far bottom corner of a larger floating landmass simply known as 'the rock.' Within the settlment are a few dozen goblins, and very few other races with the current count being only one Kor and two Elves. Once a possible meditation location for the Lithomancer responsible for the hedrons, gravity is lessened here and hedrons tend to congregate, with houses made out of many of them.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>The Rock</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Filled with an obscene amount of spindly tunnels once carved by a wurm, The rock is the central expeditionary location for the denizens of the Increk, unbeknownst to them, it having many other forms of entities lurking inside, including one of the six, Abyzof, the great shade.</p>
				</blockquote>

		<h2>Locations on Ravnica</h2>
		<td><img src="images/Ravnica.jpg" width="100%"/></td>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
			<h4>Tothur's Apartment</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Originally a bachelor pad of Tothur, On Opal lane now serving as the home for Avelyn and he, as close to the center of the Boros garrisons he works at and the Selesnayan training grounds Avelyn works at. It is also only a few blocks away from the Selesnayan garden the couple often go on dates at.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>Lek's Apothecary</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Owned by the devkarin elf Lek and his sister, Trik, this apothecary is filled to the brim with potions brewed by the latter and more often run by the former, who doesn't have the same magic touch his sister has when it comes to brewing. Just up the street from it is the alleyway that Avelyn was almost mugged in.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>Selesnayan Gardens</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hedge rows, flowers and trees everywhere, with rolling hills and little streams in the middle of the city, this garden-park is upkept by a band of centaurs that live in the area. It is going to be on a downswing due to one of those centaurs dying in the Rakdos fighting pit after never having been able to get up.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h4>Rakdos Fighting Pit</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Covered in rough and dark sand, often littered with bodies and weapons, and the time of day dictates whether the bodies are dead or unconscious. Borthod the demon watches over this specific field and in the latest events that transpired, used it as the location of his spark reaping, tossing those who survived the barrage of imps further into the undercity, attempting to feed the great leviathan that lurks under it named Wertherent.</p>
