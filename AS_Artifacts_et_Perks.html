		<h3>Artifacts</h3> <p><i>- Unique items that can be found or given to the players.</i></p>
			<blockquote>
				<h4>Journal of the Ceased</h4>
					<blockquote>
						<p>This artifact can be given by the players when visiting the oracle Chisis,
						a classic feminist Naga in the temple of Kefnet. When asked for information 
						on the planes, the plane locked oracle only knows one thing that could possibly
						help this trio that will soon venture further than she could even imagine, a
						journal passed between three 'walkers that call Amonkhet one of their homes.</p>
						<p>Each page is titled with a different name for a plane, with three
						distinct handwritings as paragraphs of text. The first is hastily written
						and usually offers a brief and almost unreadable description of a specific
						plane, each rushed block signed, Samut. The second paragraph usually offers
						up a specific unique race native to the new plane and whether that plane has
						any sands (which is usually dissapointed if it doesn't). Along with these, a
						rough sketch of one of these people of the race, all signed Basri Ket. Lastly,
						an angrily written description of the reptilians native to any plane, and is
						even missing on certain planes, seemingly on ones where dragons don't exist,
						simply signed, Vol.</p>
						<p>There are dozens of copies of this book because the Vizier has two
						mummified servants copying the script perfectly, allowing her to hand out
						the copy given to the players.</p>
						<p><i>Effects</i> - When pulled out on insight checks about a new world, it 
						can grant advantage on these rolls.</p>
					</blockquote>
				<h4>A Lazotep Pickaxe</h4>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Found at the top of a pile of Lazotep mined by Heptor's servant mummies at 
						Heptor's pit, this carved wooden hanndle hoists a large shimmering, but dark blue
						pick-axe head atop it. When it's magical properties are glimpsed, it shimmers a
						brilliant fiery blue, with a slight heat to it as well.</p>
						<p><i>Effects</i> - Must be properly attuned - When a foe is struck with the pick, 
						they must make a CON(7) save or be instantly incarcerated into a sarcophagus made
						of the valuable blue Amonkhet mineral. Otherwise, it deals 1d4 (1d6 Versatile) 
						piercing damage.</p>
					</blockquote>

						with advantage (2d6's) with the player (or DM) explaining the target location on their homeplane.</p>
